# Sets the maximum file size of current when svlogd should rotate the current log file to size bytes.
# Default is 1000000. If size is zero, svlogd doesn’t rotate log files.
# You should set size to at least (2 * len).
s1000000

# Sets the number of old log files svlogd should maintain to num.
# If svlogd sees more that num old log files in log after log file rotation,
# it deletes the oldest one. Default is 10. If num is zero, svlogd doesn’t remove old log files.
n0

# Sets the maximum age of the current log file when svlogd should rotate the current
# log file to timeout seconds. If current is timeout seconds old, and is not empty,
# svlogd forces log file rotation.
#ttimeout

# Tells svlogd to feed each recent log file through processor (see above) on log
# file rotation. By default log files are not processed.
#!processor

# Tells svlogd to transmit the first len characters of selected log messages to
# the IP address a.b.c.d, port number port. If port isn’t set, the default port
# for syslog is used (514). len can be set through the -l option, see below.
# If svlogd has trouble sending udp packets, it writes error messages to the
# log directory. Attention: logging through udp is unreliable, and should be
# used in private networks only.
#ua.b.c.d[:port]

# Is the same as the u line above, but the log messages are no longer written to
# the log directory, but transmitted through udp only. Error messages from
# svlogd concerning sending udp packages still go to the log directory.
#Ua.b.c.d[:port]

# Tells svlogd to prefix each line to be written to the log directory,
# to standard error, or through UDP, with prefix.
